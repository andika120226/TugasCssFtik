            The Technocrat Education Institute, which has been appointed as a
            pilot model for the national level Double System Education Program
            (link and match), was established on 19 February 1986 using the name
            "Technocrat Course and Guidance" with the permission of the Ministry
            of Education and Culture (Depdiknas) of Lampung Province. This
            institution was founded by Nasrullah Yusuf with a capital of a used
            Bajaj motorcycle which was sold for IDR 1,600,000. At the beginning
            of its establishment, it only used one building that was rented for
            Rp. 1,000,000 per year, with equipment designed by themselves,
            namely two chalkboards, 50 wooden chairs, one administrative desk,
            and a manual typewriter.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">
            The programs held at the beginning of its establishment were still
            limited to courses in English, Accounting, Tutoring, and Manual
            Typing. The learning community when it was first opened in March
            1986 consisted of 32 residents learning English (2 classes), 22
            residents studying Accounting, and 8 residents learning manual
            typing. In May 1986 Tutoring began with 3 participants. There were
            only two teaching staff at that time, namely Nasrullah Yusuf himself
            who taught English, Accounting, Typing, Tutoring and concurrently
            administration, and Mrs. Hernaini Nasrul teaches English and Manual
            Typing.
